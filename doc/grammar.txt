Purpose: Design of a shape language that will be used to implement a C++ to
PostScript library for drawing shapes.


operations = rotated | scaled | layered | vertical | horizontal;

rotated = shape, rotation angle;
scaled = shape, number, number;
layered = {shape};
horizontal = {shape};

shape = circle | polygon | rectangle | spacer | square | triangle;

polygon = square | triangle | positive number, positive number;
rectangle = positive number, positive number;
spacer = rectangle;

circle = positive number;
square = positive number;
triangle = positive number;


rotation angle = "90" | "180" | "270";
number = (-00, 00); // sorry, breaking syntax
positive number = [0 - 00);
