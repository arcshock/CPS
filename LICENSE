    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS FUCKING IS". OH, YOU WANT A WARRANTY? 
    OH, YOU THINK JUST BY GETTING HOLD OF THIS SHIT IMPLIES A WARRANTY, 
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE? YOU THINK YOUR 
    FUCKING LAME "SAAS" WEBSITE IS GOING TO MAKE YOU A MILLIONAIRE, AND YOU 
    WANT TO BLAME US IF SHIT GOES WHACK? WELL FUCK YOU! IT FUCKING WELL DOES 
    NOT! WE TOTALLY DISCLAIM ANY OF THAT SHIT. LISTEN HARD: THERE IS NO 
    FUCKING WAY THAT WE WILL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE CRAP YOU WANT TO 
    TRY AND PIN ON US:
      1. WE DISCLAIM DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE - DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
         SPECIAL,  EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL. WHO THE FUCK KNEW THAT THERE 
         WERE SO MANY TYPES OF DAMAGES? AND YET HERE WE ARE DISCLAIMING THEM 
         ALL.
      2. IF YOU USE THIS SOFTWARE AND END UP HAVING TO BUY NEW SHIT, OR
         HIRE SOME ACNE-RIDDEN NERD TO FIX STUFF THAT WENT WRONG, OR IF 
         SHIT GETS FUCKED UP SO BAD YOU HAVE DOWNTIME, WIPE YOUR DATA,
         LOSE PROFITS, OR SUDDENLY CAN'T ACCESS REDDIT.COM, WE DON'T 
         FUCKING CARE AND IT'S NOT OUR FAULT. CONSIDER IT ALL DISCLAIMED, 
         MUTHAFUCKER.
      3. WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF YOU HAVE SOME FUCKING "THEORY" OF
         LIABILITY. YOUR THEORY OF LIABILITY IS NOT GOING TO SAVE YOUR ASS.
         YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WE'RE FUCKING DISCLAIMING LIABILITY RIGHT
         HERE; RIGHT NOW. THAT INCLUDES CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
         (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) AND THAT APPLIES TO ALL THE
         DAMAGES WE MENTIONED ABOVE. EVEN IF WE FUCKING TOLD YOU. EVEN IF WE
         SAID "HEY, IF YOU USE THIS SOFTWARE, YOUR COMPUTER WILL BLOW UP".
         WHICH IT MIGHT.
    
    THE FUCKING END
